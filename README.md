# CV Image Classification Pipeline

## 1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end image classification system that predicts the class of an input image using supervised learning techniques.

- Input: Image
- Output: Class label
- Task: Image Classification
- Success Metric: Accuracy, F1-score

## 2. Project Structure
This project follows a modular structure separating experimentation, training, evaluation, and inference to mimic real-world ML workflows.

## 3. Current Status
Sprint 0 – Project initialization and problem definition.

## 4. Data Understanding (Sprint 1)
- Dataset: CIFAR-10
- Number of training samples: 50,000
- Number of test samples: 10,000
- Image size: 32x32 RGB
- Dataset is balanced across 10 classes

Initial visual inspection shows that images are low-resolution, which may impact classification performance.

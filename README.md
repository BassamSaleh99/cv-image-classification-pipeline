# CV Image Classification Pipeline

## 1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end image classification system that predicts the class of an input image using supervised learning techniques.

- Input: Image
- Output: Class label
- Task: Image Classification
- Success Metric: Accuracy, F1-score

## 2. Project Structure
This project follows a modular structure separating experimentation, training, evaluation, and inference to mimic real-world ML workflows.

## 3. Current Status
Sprint 0 – Project initialization and problem definition.
